## Features

### Visuals & Rendering

**Adaptive Color Engine** — The pill's background color and visualizer accent are automatically extracted from the dominant color of the current track's album art, and update smoothly on every track change.

**Four Visualizer Modes** — Choose between Off, Wave (smooth continuous sine-like waveform), Beat (jumpy bar animation), or Real-Time (requires the `cava` package for live audio visualization). Bar count, bar width, height, and margin are all independently configurable.

**Per-Layer Transparency** — Transparency can be enabled globally and then applied individually to the background, album art, text, and visualizer, giving full compositing control without coupling layers together.

**Sync GNOME Accent Color** — Dynamically changes the GNOME Shell system accent color to match the dominant color of the currently playing album art, unifying the whole desktop aesthetic.

**Custom Color Override** — When adaptive colors are not desired, a full custom color mode lets you set fixed background and text colors via a color picker, overriding the dynamic system entirely.

**Pill Shadow** — An optional drop shadow can be applied to the main pill widget with independent control over blur radius and intensity.

**Outline Border** — A subtle border around the pill can be shown or hidden independently of the background and transparency settings.

**Dynamic Width** — The pill can automatically resize its width to fit the current track title, with the configured width acting as a maximum cap. Changes are animated with a crossfade.

### Playback Controls

**Configurable Click Actions** — Five interaction types can each be assigned an independent action: Left Click, Double Click, Middle Click, Right Click, and Hover. Available actions are: None, Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track, Open Player App, Close Player App, Open Pop-Up Menu, Select Player, and Open Settings.

**Hover Delay** — When a Hover action is assigned, a configurable delay (0–3000 ms) prevents the action from triggering immediately on accidental cursor contact.

**Scroll to Change Volume** — Scrolling over the pill adjusts system volume via PulseAudio/PipeWire with GNOME OSD feedback. A built-in delta accumulator ensures smooth and accurate behavior on high-resolution touchpads.

**Scroll to Change Track** — The scroll action can alternatively be set to skip forward or backward through the track queue.

**Scroll to Switch Player** — A third scroll mode cycles through active MPRIS-compatible media players, letting you control multiple apps without opening a menu.

**Scroll Direction Inversion** — Both the scroll animation direction (visual jump effect) and the actual scroll direction (up/down mapping for track and volume) can be inverted independently.

**Tablet Mode Controls** — A dedicated on-pill button overlay for touch and tablet use. Configurable to show Skip Only, Play/Pause Only, or All Controls directly on the pill surface.

**Always ON Mode** — The pill retains the last known track metadata and stays visible even after the media player is closed, instead of disappearing when no active player is detected.

**Hide Default GNOME Player** — Suppresses the built-in media controls widget in the GNOME Quick Settings panel to avoid duplicate interfaces.

### Display & Text

**Scrolling Track Title** — When the track title or artist name exceeds the available pill width, the text scrolls horizontally.

**Inline Artist** — When the pill is narrow or squeezed, the display can switch to a combined "Title • Artist" single-line format.

**Compact Mode** — Hides the title and artist text entirely, leaving only the album art and visualizer visible for a minimal footprint.

**Fallback Album Art** — A custom image file (PNG or JPEG) can be set as a fallback to display when the current track provides no album art.

**Synchronized Lyrics** — Real-time lyric display synchronized to the current track's playback position. Lyrics can optionally fade in with a configurable transition duration (50–2000 ms).

### Pop-Up Menu

**Seek Bar** — A fully interactive seek bar allows jumping to any position in the current track directly from the pop-up, without opening the player application.

**Spinning Vinyl** — The album art in the pop-up rotates continuously while music is playing, pausing automatically on pause. Rotation speed is adjustable (1–50).

**Square Album Art Mode** — The album art in the pop-up can be shown as a square instead of circular. When square mode is active, the spinning animation is automatically disabled.

**Shuffle and Loop Controls** — Optional shuffle and repeat toggle buttons can be shown in the pop-up alongside the standard playback controls.

**Custom Control Buttons** — Up to two additional buttons can be added to the pop-up controls row. Each button can be assigned one of: Volume, Seek Step, Audio Output, Sleep Timer, Playback Speed, or Recently Played history.

**Player Selector** — An optional row at the top of the pop-up displays icons for all currently active MPRIS players, allowing switching between players with a single click.

**Pop-up Visualizer** — The audio visualizer can also be displayed inside the pop-up menu, with its own independent bar count (2–64), bar width (1–20 px), and height (20–200 px) settings. A complementary option hides the main pill visualizer when the pop-up is open, creating a visual transfer effect.

**Dynamic Menu Resizing** — When skipping tracks from the pop-up, the menu smoothly resizes and crossfades to accommodate different album art dimensions.

**Close on Mouse Leave** — The pop-up can be configured to automatically close when the cursor moves away from it.

**Custom Pop-up Width** — The pop-up menu's automatic dynamic sizing can be overridden with a fixed custom width (260–800 px).

**Pop-up Styling Inheritance** — The pop-up can independently inherit the pill's background transparency, corner radius, custom background color, and custom text color.

**Dynamic Contrast** — Pop-up text and control buttons automatically switch between light and dark based on the album art's luminance, maintaining readability on both bright and dark covers.

### Layout & Positioning

**Four Placement Targets** — The pill can be placed in the Dock (requires Dash-to-Dock or Ubuntu Dock), or in any of the three Top Panel zones: Left Box, Center Box, or Right Box.

**Alignment Presets** — Within the chosen container, the pill can be aligned to First (Start), Center, Last (End), or placed at a manually specified index position.

**Independent Offset Control** — Vertical (Y) and Horizontal (X) offsets can be fine-tuned independently, with separate profiles stored for Dock mode and Panel mode.

**Independent Size Profiles** — Widget width, height, and album art thumbnail size are stored separately for Dock and Panel modes, with different valid ranges appropriate to each context.

**Corner Radius** — Controls the roundness of the widget edges globally, from fully square (0) to a complete pill shape (50+).

**Outer Edge Margin** — Adds spacing before the album art and after the visualizer to control padding at the pill's outer edges.

### Performance

**Game Mode** — Detects when a fullscreen application is focused and automatically disables the visualizer and all CSS animations to eliminate compositor overhead. Resumes automatically when the fullscreen application closes.

**Slow Player Workaround** — Adds a slight delay to track change handling to fix synchronization issues with players that emit metadata updates slightly after the track change signal.

### Multi-Player Management

**Player Filter** — Players can be filtered using a Blacklist (exclude named players) or Whitelist (allow only named players) mode, with the filter list editable as comma-separated MPRIS app names. Currently active players are detected live via D-Bus and can be added to the filter list with a single click.

**Manual App ID Mapping** — When the extension cannot automatically identify a player's window for Open/Close App actions, a manual mapping table allows pairing an MPRIS player name to its correct window App ID. Running players are detected via D-Bus and can be registered with one click, then edited in-place or deleted individually.

**Selected Player Lock** — The extension tracks which player is currently selected and maintains focus on it across track changes and player restarts.

### Settings Management

**Export Settings** — The complete configuration is serialized to a `.json` file saved to a user-selected path for backup or transfer between machines.

**Import Settings** — A previously exported `.json` file can be loaded to instantly restore a full configuration.

**Factory Reset** — All settings are reset to their defaults in a single action.

#### App ID Mapping

When the extension cannot automatically identify a media player's window for the Open/Close App actions, a manual mapping table allows pairing the MPRIS player name to its correct window App ID.

Running players are detected live via D-Bus. Clicking **Use This** next to a detected player adds it to the mapping table. You then type in the correct App ID and save. Saved mappings can be edited in-place or deleted individually.

To find a player's App ID: press `Alt+F2`, type `lg`, open the **Windows** tab, and look at the `wmclass:` or `app:` field for the player window. Remove the `.desktop` suffix if present.

Common App ID examples:

| Player | App ID |
|---|---|
| Spotify (Flatpak) | `com.spotify.Client` |
| VLC | `vlc` |
| YouTube Music (web app) | `youtube-music` |
| High Tide | `io.github.nokse22.high-tide` |
| Chromium | `chromium` |
| Firefox | `firefox` |

#### Backup & Restore

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| Export Settings | Serializes the entire current configuration to a `.json` file at a user-chosen path. |
| Import Settings | Loads a previously exported `.json` file and applies all stored settings instantly. |
| Factory Reset | Resets every setting to its default value. This action cannot be undone. |
